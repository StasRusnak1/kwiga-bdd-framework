Feature: Terms of use from footer
  Scenario: Open Terms of use page from footer
    Given app baseUrl "https://kwiga.com"
    And browser "chrome" headless true
    When I open "home"
    And I click footer link "Terms and Conditions"
    Then I expect page contains text "PLEASE STUDY THIS DOCUMENT ATTENTIVELY."
