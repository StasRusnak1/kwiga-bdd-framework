Feature: Footer Book a demo link
  Scenario: Clicking Book a demo opens booking page in new tab
    Given app baseUrl "https://kwiga.com"
    And browser "chrome" headless true
    When I open "home"
    And I click footer link "Book a demo"
    And I switch to new tab
    Then I expect page contains text "Demo call with Kwiga"
