Feature: Logo navigation to homepage
  Scenario: Clicking logo from inner page returns to homepage
    Given app baseUrl "https://kwiga.com"
    And browser "chrome" headless true
    When I open "home"
    And I click header menu "LMS"
    And I click css ".header__logo"
    Then I expect current url contains "kwiga.com"
