Feature: Book a demo CTA from hero
  Scenario: Clicking Book a demo opens booking page in new tab
    Given app baseUrl "https://kwiga.com"
    And browser "chrome" headless true
    When I open "home"
    And I click button "Book a demo"
    And I switch to new tab
    Then I expect current url contains "calendly.com"
